# Data-2-Audio

This was my first effort at converting data to audio, and my first Python script. It was initially developed at a
Joint Education Development Initiative (JEDI) workshop, hosted in Windhoek, Namibia, July 2014 under the leadership
of Prof. Bruce Bassett, PhD. as an outreach extension of the Square Kilometre Array, South Africa, where I conducted
my MSc research 2014-16.

It was a great getting-hands-dirty project, a chance to dive into Python in a context which was familiar to me.

This effort carried forward into a feature construction project, using audio filters as a means of describing complex
data structures, applied to Machine Learning.

This is SUPER simple, but quite powerful too.

Have fun! --kai
